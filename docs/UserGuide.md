<p align="center">
<img src="images/UiLabel.png" alt="Ui Label">

</div>

### 4.3 Dashboard  

Whenever you start up Productiv, you will be brought to the dashboard, which gives you an overview of your product-related information.
Referencing Figure 1 above, you can see the Overall Completion Percentage (OCP) displayed in the left panel. 
The OCP gives you a quick overview of the progress of your product’s development.
Also, your schedule will be displayed in the right panel. 
It contains all your deliverables and meetings, chronologically sorted.

### 4.4 Command preview  

All that's left now is to execute some simple commands in Productiv!
This can be done by typing in the command box and pressing the Enter key. 
Here is a sequence of example commands you can try:

   1. `view 1`: Displays the 1st deliverable shown.
   
   1. `delete 1`: Deletes the 1st deliverable shown.

And it's as simple as that! But of course, there's more to just these three commands.
